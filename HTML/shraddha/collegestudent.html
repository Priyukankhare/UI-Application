            <h2>DIVERSITY IN COLLEGE</h2>
            <P>Diversity is essential in the college and university experience because exposure to different people and their perspectives allows students to learn from one another.
                "Diversity gives you a chance for something new," Racster says. "We don't want to be stuck in an echo chamber where we're just talking our ideas back to each other.
                "Diversity allows for innovation and a way to improve your interpersonal skills," Racster continues. "When faced with a diverse crowd, you must expand your skill set and worldview to incorporate new ideas."
                A diverse student body is essential to promote the atmosphere of creation, speculation, and experimentation necessary for higher education. Diversity enhances education, and students gain intellectual benefits from being exposed to peers from diverse backgrounds. It also bolsters support for upholding affirmative action in higher education.
